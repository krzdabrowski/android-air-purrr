# Air Purrr - Android app

This app written in Kotlin controls self-made air purifier and reads PM2.5/10 values from air quality detector and closest location (using Airly API).

### Getting Started

This is my first own project ever created so bugs are more than likely. Also, keep in mind that app is currently in development, including vast code refactoring.

### Self-Made Air Purifier

See back-end [README.md](https://github.com/krzdabrowski/back-end-air-purrr) for more details.

### Airly API

From now, app uses Airly API instead of GIOS's one. You need to register your account [here](https://developer.airly.eu) (free), obtain an API key and add it to `gradle.properties` file in your .gradle home directory. More instructions [here](https://medium.com/code-better/hiding-api-keys-from-your-android-repository-b23f5598b906).
